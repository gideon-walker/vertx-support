Iâ€™ll explain the attached photos.

- All measurements are taken outer seam to inner seam
- Waistband is spot on, 16 inches front side for both
- As you move down the legs, the differences become obvious. The bad fit jeans are exactly 1 inch shorter in all the measurements I took.
- Bad fit thigh measures 8 inches, good fit thigh measures 9 inches
- Bad fit cuff measures 5 1/4 inches, good fit cuff measures 6 1/4 inches
- One picture of bad fit on top of good fit, should not be able to see bottom pair but you can see the edges
